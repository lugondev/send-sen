## Architecture

The project follows a clean architecture pattern:
1. **Modules**: Contain the core business logic and define interfaces (ports)
2. **Adapters**: Implement the interfaces defined by modules to connect with external services
3. **Configuration**: Centralized configuration management using Viper
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with mock adapters for testing

## Configuration

### YAML Configuration
Create a `config.yaml` file:

## Testing
The project includes comprehensive testing support:

### Mock Adapters
- Mock adapters in `adapters/email/mock.go` for email testing
- Mock adapters in `adapters/sms/mock.go` for SMS testing
- Mock adapters in `adapters/notify/mock.go` for notification testing

## Code Style Guidelines

1. Follow Go's standard code style and conventions
2. Use meaningful variable and function names
3. Add appropriate comments for public functions and complex logic
4. Implement proper error handling and logging
5. Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
6. Write unit tests for new functionality

## Implementation Guidelines

### For new adapters
- Implement the appropriate interface from the modules package
- Add comprehensive logging
- Include proper error handling
- Add tests in the tests directory

### For bug fixes
- Identify the root cause
- Add tests that reproduce the issue
- Fix the issue
- Verify that the tests pass

### For refactoring
- Ensure all tests pass before and after changes
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Update documentation if interfaces change

## Building and Running

The project is a library, so there's no need to build it separately. However, when testing changes:

```bash
# Verify that the code compiles
go build ./...

# Run tests
go test ./tests/...
```
